##üìñ Introduction

This project is built using React and Material-UI. It consists of a simple input form where users can enter a country name and submit it. The app demonstrates basic React concepts such as state management and component interaction.

##‚ú® Features

Simple user interface with a text input and submit button.
State management using React hooks.
Component-based architecture.
Integration with Material-UI for styling and layout.

##üíª Installation
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
```
git clone https://github.com/Shubhamshinde9528/select-country-project.git
```
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
```
cd select-country-project
```
Install dependencies:
bash
```
npm install
```
##üöÄ Usage

To run the project locally, use the following command:

bash
```
npm start
```
Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to see the application in action.

##üß™ Running Tests
This project uses @testing-library/react for testing. To run the tests, use the following command:

bash
```
npm test
```
Example Test
The following is an example test case that checks if a specific link is present in the document:
```
javascript
Copy code
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import App from './App';

test('renders learn react link', () => {
  render(<App />);
  const linkElement = screen.getByText(/learn react/i);
  expect(linkElement).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```
Explanation of the Test Code

The test imports the necessary functions and the App component.

The render function from @testing-library/react is used to render the App component.

The screen.getByText method searches for an element with the text "learn react" (case-insensitive) within the rendered component.

The expect function checks if the found element is present in the document.

##üìÑ Component Description

Selectcountry Component
The Selectcountry component allows the user to input a country name and submit it. Here's a breakdown of the component:
``` Code
Imports
javascript
Copy code
import React, { useState } from "react";
import TextField from "@mui/material/TextField";
import Box from "@mui/material/Box";
import Stack from "@mui/material/Stack";
import Button from "@mui/material/Button";
```
React and useState: Used for creating the component and managing state.
Material-UI components: Used for styling and layout (though not utilized in the provided JSX).
Component Definition
```
javascript
Copy code
function Selectcountry(props) {
  const [data, setData] = React.useState("");
State Initialization: A state variable data is initialized to an empty string.
Event Handlers
javascript
Copy code
  function handleChange(event) {
    const { value } = event.target;
    setData(value);
  }
  function handleClick() {
    props.location(data);
  }
```
handleChange: Updates the state variable data with the input field's value.
handleClick: Calls the location function passed in through props, passing the current value of data.

JSX Structure
```
javascript
Copy code
  return (
    <div className="input">
      <input className="inputField" onChange={handleChange} />
